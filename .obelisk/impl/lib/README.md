# Obelisk libraries

This directory contains libraries provided by obelisk. By convention they are prefixed with `obelisk-` and their module exports all lie within the `Obelisk` import namespace. For example, to include `cliapp` as a dependency you would add `obelisk-cliapp` to your cabal dependencies, and import `Obelisk.CliApp...` in the source files.
